			<p class="p0 ft1"> 
				With over two decades of profound experience in the technology domain, I have consistently pioneered and delivered cutting-edge solutions 
				across a spectrum of projects spanning cloud development, big data, and enterprise product innovation. Currently holding the esteemed position 
				of Senior Engineering Manager at HERE Technologies, I lead a groundbreaking program that unites multiple teams comprising highly proficient 
				Data Engineers and Data Scientists. Our collective mission is nothing short of revolutionary: we are reshaping global map-making processes by 
				deploying cutting-edge AI/ML techniques.

				My ardor for technology harmoniously complements my passion for nurturing talent. I have diligently cultivated and mentored my teams, 
				guiding them to attain peak performance and successfully steering them through a multitude of projects. These endeavors have yielded substantial 
				cost savings, performance enhancements, and the successful launch of innovative products. My unwavering belief in fostering a culture of 
				Collaboration, empowerment, and excellence have been instrumental in creating an environment where every team member can flourish and evolve.

				By amalgamating my extensive technological acumen with my exceptional team management prowess, my goal is to be a catalyst for positive change, 
				a source of inspiration for growth, and a creator of enduring impact, not just in the realm of technology but also in the broader context of 
				our world.
