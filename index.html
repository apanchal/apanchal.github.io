			of Senior Engineering Manager at HERE Technologies, I lead a groundbreaking program that unites multiple teams comprising highly proficient

			cost savings, performance enhancements, and the successful launch of innovative products. My unwavering belief in fostering a culture of 
			Collaboration, empowerment, and excellence have been instrumental in creating an environment where every team member can flourish and evolve.

			By amalgamating my extensive technological acumen with my exceptional team management prowess, my goal is to be a catalyst for positive change, 
			a source of inspiration for growth, and a creator of enduring impact, not just in the realm of technology but also in the broader context of 
			our world.
