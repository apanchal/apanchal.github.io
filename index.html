			<p class="p8 ft13">My Background</p>
			<hr class="new1">
			<p class="p5 ft1">
			Hi! My name is Aashish Panchal. I am a technology enthusiast with business acumen, a wisdom seeker, influencer. I’m an engineer turned manager and have worked with a lot of early/late-stage start-ups and MNCs for last 20 years. 
			I have been leading a strong squad which built habit-forming, end to end tech products with great customer experience at scale. This gives me the unique experience of learning what works and what doesn’t at both ends of the scale spectrum. I have a passion for using technology to build products that solve real world problems.
			What I am most passionate though is managing engineers and building great high performing but empathetic teams.
			I spend most of my weekends learning new stuff on medium, dzone, GitHub, and high scalability.
